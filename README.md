🏨 Hostel Management & Booking System

This is a full-stack Hostel Management and Bed Booking System built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Colleges can register, upload student ranks via Excel, and manage hostels, rooms, beds, and bookings through a secure admin dashboard. Students log in using their rank to view real-time availability and book beds. The system includes authentication, booking validation, and cancellation functionality to ensure secure and efficient hostel management.
